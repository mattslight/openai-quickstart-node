{ "text": "When Jaspa awarded us with the build for their new office, they had one very specific ask – they wanted a vegan office."}
{ "text": "At first, we weren’t sure how we would translate these principles into construction, but this was a challenge we looked forward to, because we knew how much it meant to our client. Due to religious reasons, Jaspa wanted an office that did no harm to animals nor the environment. So, we hit the books and started learning about vegan and Hindu values."}
{ "text": "We had to build with consciousness and meticulously research all our materials. Our client was part of the process every step of the way to be sure our designs were in line with these values. Our designs were checked twice and it took nearly 2 years to perfect it. Our client had incredible attention to detail, so we made sure everything was according to his standards."}
{ "text": "Through collaboration, we expanded on these principles and brought innovation to the space. The phone booths could be transformed into a private meditation space through the use of roller blinds. We also created spaces for worship and well-being."}
{ "text": "After months of preparation it was exciting to see the office space unfold before us as we started construction. It was rewarding to exceed the client’s expectations, to see our hard work pay off, and to honour his values in the project – some of which we adopted ourselves!"}

{ "text": "The brief asked the question: how can we create a space that’s functional, flexible, and collaborative while capturing our history and identity?"}
{ "text": "Maersk is dynamic, and so are their teams. That’s why they needed a large group working area – a multi-functional breakout zone for close-knit collaboration."}
{ "text": "Throughout the three floors, we placed a number of lounge areas to accommodate varied needs; singular work, group work, hot desking, and informal team meetings."}
{ "text": "This was supplemented by a collection of smaller, modular zones that permit multi team work, and a space that doubles up as a café and a ‘town hall’ type meeting area."}
{ "text": "On behalf of the entire family at KPS, we’d like to thank everyone who was involved in making this project what it is."}

{ "text": "The building itself is a peculiar u-shape, featuring an interior divided into three wings that flow with the curvature of the building."}
{ "text": "Though there’s several compartmentalised spaces, it feels like you’re in the same office with its free-flowing, open plan layout."}
